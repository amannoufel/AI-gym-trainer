## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)
- Google Cloud project with Gemini API enabled + API Key
- `gym2.py` file in the same directory (for workout tracking)
- Image assets in an `images/` folder (used by the UI)

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pillow pymongo google-generativeai
```

> _Note: `tkinter` is typically bundled with Python, but if it's not, install it via your package manager._

### 3. Configuration
- **MongoDB:** Update the `connection_string` variable in `main.py` with your connection URI. Ensure your database is named `aitrainer`.
- **Google Gemini API:** Replace the placeholder API key in `main.py` with your own.
- **Assets & Modules:** Confirm that `gym2.py` and the `images/` folder are in the correct directory.

### 4. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```

# AI Trainer – Your Personalized Workout Companion 🏋️‍♂️🤖

**AI Trainer** is an intelligent, GUI-based fitness companion built with Python’s Tkinter. It combines real-time workout tracking with AI-powered guidance to offer a smart, personalized fitness experience. Users can log workouts, ask fitness-related questions, and review their progress — all within a sleek and interactive interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 User Authentication
- Secure login and sign-up with persistent user profiles.

### 💪 Workout Tracking
- Buttons for common exercises: curls, squats, push-ups, shoulder presses, bench presses.
- Integration with an external module (`gym2.py`) that tracks repetitions — potentially using sensors or computer vision.
- Automatically logs workouts with exercise type, rep count, and date.

### 📊 Workout History
- Displays a scrollable log of past workouts, showing exercises performed, rep count, and timestamps.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Fitness Q&A
- Users can ask fitness and health-related questions.
- Utilizes Google’s **Gemini Pro** model to give intelligent, personalized responses based on user data (name, age, height, weight).
- Interactive conversation with an "Ask Another" feature for follow-up questions.

### 🖥️ Intuitive and Visual Interface
- Clean, user-friendly interface with custom images and smooth hover effects.
- Navigation sidebar for seamless movement between different sections.

### 💾 Data Persistence
- Uses MongoDB for securely storing user credentials and workout data.

### 🧩 Modular Code Design
- Separated functions and logical structure make the codebase easy to maintain and extend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** – Core language
- **Tkinter** – GUI development
- **Pillow (PIL)** – Image handling
- **Pymongo** – MongoDB integration
- **Google Generative AI API** – AI-powered Q&A system
- **MongoDB** – Cloud or local database storage
- **`gym2.py`** – External module for rep tracking (likely using computer vision or sensors)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cluster)
- Google Cloud project with Gemini API enabled + API Key
- `gym2.py` file in the same directory (for workout tracking)
- Image assets in an `images/` folder (used by the UI)

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pillow pymongo google-generativeai
```

> _Note: `tkinter` is typically bundled with Python, but if it's not, install it via your package manager._

### 3. Configuration
- **MongoDB:** Update the `connection_string` variable in `main.py` with your connection URI. Ensure your database is named `aitrainer`.
- **Google Gemini API:** Replace the placeholder API key in `main.py` with your own.
- **Assets & Modules:** Confirm that `gym2.py` and the `images/` folder are in the correct directory.

### 4. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧭 Usage Guide

1. **Login / Sign Up:** New users can register, while returning users can log in using existing credentials.
2. **Home:** Main dashboard with navigation buttons.
3. **Workout:** Select an exercise to start tracking. The app (via `gym2.py`) monitors and records your performance.
4. **Question:** Ask fitness-related questions. Responses are tailored to your profile using the Gemini AI model.
5. **History:** Scroll through your workout logs to review your progress.
6. **Logout:** Securely log out and return to the login screen.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Rep Tracking:** Improve `gym2.py` for more accurate and real-time feedback using computer vision or IMUs.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling:** Better handling for network failures, bad input, and session timeouts.
- **Progress Visualizations:** Graphs and charts to visualize progress over time.
- **Custom Exercises:** Allow users to define and add their own workout types.
- **Voice Interaction:** Use speech recognition for hands-free question answering and workout control.
- **Mobile Support:** Port the app to Android using Kivy or a cross-platform toolkit.
